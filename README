ScribblePad
-----------
A small experiment that I intend to turn into a Google Wave gadget.


Usage
-----
1. Create a canvas element in your document and give it a unique id attribute.
	<canvas id="foo" width="400" height="300" />

2. Include the scribblepad.js in the header.
	<script type="text/javascript" src="scribblepad.js"></script>

3. Attach a ScribblePad to the canvas element using it's id on window load.
	new ScribblePad('foo');

* See index.html for a demo.


Options
-------
Currently there is only one option:

	Option       Description
	-----------  -------------------
	lineWidth    pixels (integer)

Options can be passed in using an object.
	new ScribblePad('foo', {
		'lineWidth': 4
	});


Known Issues
------------
It currently only works in Firefox, Chrome & Camino, i.e. It currently doesn't
work in Safari and Opera.
